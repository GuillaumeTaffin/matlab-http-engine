# MATLAB HTTP Engine API

This project is built on top of the [MATLAB Engine API Java](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/java-api-summary.html).

It consists in a lightweight HTTP server, written in plain Java, that can be started without other dependencies from the MATLAB JVM. It exposes the engine API through an HTTP interface that any program on the machine can then access.
